Your touch ignites a flame that never fades, a flame that burns brighter with each passing day. I love you more with every breath, more with every beat of my heart. You're my forever home, my safe haven, my guiding star.",

Your love is my anchor, my shelter from life's tempests, my haven where I am free to be me. With you, every day is a new adventure, every night a sweet serenade. You're the missing piece that makes me whole, the missing beat that makes my heart complete."]
